# Copilot Instructions for forKernels

## Project Overview
forKernels is a suite of high-performance Fortran HPC libraries optimized for modern HPC, AI, and signal-processing workloads. The project provides near-bare-metal speed through easy Python bindings.

## Repository Purpose
This repository maintains the professional website for the forKernels organization, showcasing our suite of HPC libraries available at https://github.com/forKernels.

## Key Libraries
- **forMath**: Mathematical operations and linear algebra
- **forAI**: AI and machine learning primitives
- **forDSP**: Digital signal processing kernels
- **for3D**: 3D graphics and geometry operations
- **forCUDA**: CUDA acceleration interfaces
- **forQuant**: Quantitative computing and finance

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use semantic HTML5 elements for proper structure
- Write clean, modular CSS with clear naming conventions
- Keep JavaScript vanilla (no frameworks) for performance
- Use responsive design principles (mobile-first)
- Follow web accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1)

### Content Guidelines
- **NEVER** disclose or generate source code, algorithms, or internal logic of any kernels
- Focus on product features, benefits, and use cases
- Maintain a professional, technical, B2B tone
- Emphasize performance, portability, and practical applications
- Highlight real-world use cases: AI, robotics, signal processing, edge computing

### Website Sections
The website should include:
1. **Overview**: Introduction to forKernels organization and mission
2. **Key Features**: Performance, portability, ease of use
3. **Libraries**: Brief description of each library in the suite
4. **Benchmarks**: Performance metrics and comparisons (high-level only)
5. **Supported Platforms**: OS, hardware, cloud platforms
6. **Marketplace Links**: AWS Marketplace, Google Cloud Marketplace integrations
7. **Getting Started**: How to access and integrate the libraries

### Technical Requirements
- Static site (HTML/CSS/JS only)
- Lightweight and fast-loading
- SEO-optimized with proper metadata
- Responsive design for all devices
- GitHub Pages compatible
- No build process required (pure static files)

### Deployment
- Primary: GitHub Pages
- Alternative: Netlify
- Files should be deployment-ready without build steps

### Security & Privacy
- No tracking scripts or third-party analytics
- No collection of user data
- External links should open in new tabs
- Use HTTPS for all resources

### When Making Changes
- Test responsiveness on multiple screen sizes
- Validate HTML and CSS
- Check performance (Lighthouse scores)
- Verify all links work
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Take screenshots of UI changes for review

### What NOT to Do
- Do not add framework dependencies (React, Vue, Angular)
- Do not include build tools or transpilers
- Do not expose internal implementation details
- Do not make unsubstantiated performance claims
- Do not use heavy images or unoptimized assets

## Target Audience
- DevOps engineers and platform architects
- HPC researchers and scientists
- AI/ML engineers
- Signal processing engineers
- Robotics developers
- Enterprise software teams
- Cloud solution architects
