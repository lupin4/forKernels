> Official website for forKernels - High-performance Fortran HPC libraries for modern computing

## Overview

forKernels is a suite of high-performance Fortran libraries optimized for modern HPC, AI, and signal-processing workloads. Each module delivers near-bare-metal speed through easy Python bindings.

This repository contains the source code for the forKernels organization website, built as a static site using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Available Modules

| Module | Status | PyPI | Description |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| [forOpt](forOpt/) | ✅ Production | `pip install foropt` | ML optimizers (1.4x faster than PyTorch) |
| [forBio](forBio/) | ✅ Production | `pip install forbio` | Bioinformatics (surgical robotics ready) |
| [forDSP](forDSP/) | ✅ Production | `pip install fordsp` | Audio processing (1.3ms latency) |
| [forSig](forSig/) | ✅ Production | `pip install forsig` | Signal processing |
| [forNav](forNav/) | 🚧 Beta | - | Navigation & pathfinding |
| [forFin](forFin/) | 🚧 Beta | - | Financial computing |
| [for3D](for3D/) | 🚧 Beta | - | 3D graphics & transforms |
| [forAI](forAI/) | 🚧 Beta | - | ML inference kernels |

## Local Development

To view the website locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lupin4/forKernels.git
   cd forKernels
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   open index.html
   
   # On Linux
   xdg-open index.html
   
   # On Windows
   start index.html
   ```

Alternatively, use a local web server:
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## Deployment
