# forKernels

**Fortran HPC for the Edge Layer of the Cloud Continuum**

## Overview

**forKernels** is a suite of high-performance Fortran libraries optimized for modern HPC, AI, and signal-processing workloads. Each module — **forMath**, **forCUDA**, **forDSP**, **for3D** — delivers near-bare-metal speed through clean Python bindings, accelerating linear algebra, FFT, convolution, and optimization by up to **6× compared to NumPy** on ARM and edge devices like Jetson Orin.

## Performance
